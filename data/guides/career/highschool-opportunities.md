Getting internships in college is an excellent way to gain real-world experience, network with industry professionals, and start building a strong resume. However, many students aren't aware of opportunities that are open to, and some specifically for, high school students. These opportunities often go unnoticed and can be hard to find if you don't know how to look for them. We encourage you to share this list to raise awareness about these awesome opportunities, some directly related to CS, to get hands-on experience in high school!
